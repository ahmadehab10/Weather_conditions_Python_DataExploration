<h1>Purpose of Project</h1>
<p>The purpose of this project was to import a csv file into JupyterNotebook in order to analyze the dataset and answer the key questions provided by the stakeholders. By utilizing Python and pandas i was tasked with answering those questions</p>

<h2>Questions to be answered : </h2>
<ol>
  <li>How many unique values in wind speed</li>
  <li>Number of times weather is exactly clear?</li>
  <li>Number of times wind speed was exactly 4 km/h</li>
  <li>is there any null values in the dataset?</li>
  <li>Rename column weather to weather conditions</li>
  <li>What is the mean of the visibility column?</li>
  <li> What is the standard deviation of 'Pressure' in this dataset?</li>
  <li>What is the variance of 'Relative Humidity in this dataset?</li>
  <li>Find all instances where snow was recorded?</li>
  <li>Find all instances when 'wind speed' is above 24 and 'Visibility' is 25</li>
  <li>what is the mean value of each column against each 'Weather Condition'?</li>
  <li>what is the minmum and maximum value of each column against each ' Weather condition'?</li>
  <li>Find all instances where 'Weather is clear' or 'Visibility' is above 40</li>
  <li>Find all instances where :
A) 'Weather is Clear' and 'Relative humidity' is greater than 50
OR
B) 'Visibility' is above 40</li>
  
</ol>
